# A hashtable and binary tree implementation

I did this for a data structures and algorithms assignment on my exchange semester. I wonder now why I chose such a hard subject while on exchange.

I got full marks.

We had to implement a hash table and a binary tree with some requirements.

I genuinely enjoyed doing this assignment. A lot of fun trying to figure out how these data structures work.
